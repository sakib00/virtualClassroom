# Virtual Classroom

![Home page](/public/Home.png)

This was an university project for the semester of Fall'20. I was given a deadline of two weeks, where I had to make an online classroom. Without any prior knowledge of MERN stack, I dived right into the project and had this as the final product. Even though this project is not fully complete, I look forward to completing this project in the near future.
